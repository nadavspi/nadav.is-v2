In 2013, Spotify paid $500 million to musicians. Sounds like a lot, but it's really "between $0.006 and $0.0084 [per stream]&hellip;split amongst the rights holders in accordance with the popularity of their music on the service" and then divided between the label and the artist.[^spotify] 
The music industry is in the process of reinventing itself. At least I hope so. We can't rely on record sales anymore, but the new model of renting music through Spotify or Rdio hasn’t fully matured yet. 

In the mean time, musicians are fucked. Spotify paid $500 million to musicians in 2013. Sounds respectable, but it comes down to 

We thought tecnology would make us more isolated, but it has made the world smaller instead. It’s easier to produce quality music and reach a global audience than ever before.[^name-dropping] But how do we use technology to make money from our music? Where does a YouTube sensation go? We don’t know yet, and the industry doesn’t know yet. With [big cities getting more and more expensive][big-cities], it's becoming more unrealistic to move to New York or Los Angeles and hope to "make it." I'm not as pessimistic as some; I moved to New York a month ago, but I'll be working full time as a front-end developer to allow myself to live here. I'm lucky that I love the web, otherwise I'd be struggling. 

As a musician, I’m terrified. As a young tech-savvy person in 2014, I’m excited.  

People will do whatever it takes to easily get to their content. Charge $16 for a CD and they'll pirate it on the Internet. Charge them $10 a month to access a big music library, and [maybe they won't pirate it](http://paidcontent.org/2013/07/18/charts-how-spotify-is-killing-music-piracy/). I fully subscribe—no pun intended, I swear—to that model; I listen to music on Spotify, watch TV on Netflix or Amazon, and listen to "radio" through a [podcast app](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts) on my phone.

But, I'm an early adopter and the subscription model is not without its downsides. [Khoi Vinh wrote about streaming music on Medium a few weeks ago](https://medium.com/what-im-reading-on-medium/9a56e22682d4). He laments that music won't end up under his Christmas tree this year because "[i]n the age of streaming services like Spotify and Pandora, music has become so readily available that it’s lost its *thingness*, that meaning and scarcity that makes wrapping it up and stashing it under a tree special." 

The *ritual* of music—saving up the money, going to the record store, unwrapping it, reading the liner notes—has been steadily declining and is now all but lost. Should we mourn it? I don't know. Some young people are still after music's *thingness*—that's why [vinyl records have made a comeback](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/arts/music/vinyl-records-are-making-a-comeback.html). 

Like Khoi Vinh, I look forward to better tagging and access to metadata on the online services. Browsing the massive libraries of the streaming services takes finesse, especially if—[as the Wall Street Journal points out](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304591604579290721300786680)—you're looking for Jazz or classical music.

As a Jazz fan, knowing who plays on a record is more important to me than knowing the names of the tracks. In the days of pirating MP3s, I'd spend hours looking up the personnel and filling in [ID3 tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3). With streaming music, I shouldn't have to.
