<p>This website is for me. I spend a lot of time thinking about, creating, and tinkering with stuff for the web, much of it for other people. This is my place to do all of that stuff without any outside constraints, even (or perhaps especially) when it seems self-indulgent or geeky or pointless.</p>

<p>When I decided to redesign this website, I wanted it to be more personal, to better reflect me as a person. My motivation for keeping a home for myself on the web is partly as an exercise in vulnerability and transparency: to keep a public record of who I am and who I become as it happens.</p>
