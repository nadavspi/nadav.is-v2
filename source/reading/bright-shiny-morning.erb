highlights:
    - "Her friend drives and smokes and talks she never stops talking."
    - "Artists have always had an uncomfortable relationship with money. They need it, but are often repulsed by those who have it."
    - "For as long as there has been money, and art, and people willing to spend money on art, communities initially set up by artists have been overrun with people with money who want a taste of the artistâ€™s lifestyle, despite the fact that the reality of the lifestyle is far harder, lonelier, and more boring than can be imagined."
