highlights:
    - "Old Cob tucked away his bowl of stew with the predatory efficiency of a lifetime bachelor."
    - "The roads were always bad, of course, in the same way that winter was always cold. You complained, took sensible precautions, and got on with the business of living your life."
    - "It gets tiresome being spoken to as if you are a child, even if you happen to be one."
    - "A clever, thoughtless person is one of the most terrifying things there is."
    - "When he spoke his native language, he sounded like an angry rockslide."
    - "They sat at a huge, crescent-shaped table. It was raised, so even seated they were looking down on me. They were serious-looking men, ranging in age from mature to ancient."
    - "Then, because I had nothing to do before my whipping at noon, I strolled the University aimlessly."
    - "Music is a proud, temperamental mistress. Give her the time and attention she deserves, and she is yours. Slight her and there will come a day when you call and she will not answer."
    - "“Oi taut Oi heard sommat daen tae water aways,” he said, his accent so thick and oily you could almost taste it."
