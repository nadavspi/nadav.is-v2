highlights:
    - "That’s what thinking is best at: deceiving the thinker."
    - "Here comes this black dog, like a fat seal on stumpy legs, barking its head off and wagging its whole body, and in five seconds flat we’re best mates."
    - "Dad’ll be telling Nipper the plumber and TJ the sparky and old Mr. Sharkey, “It’ll all come out in the wash,” or something else that sounds wise but means nothing."
    - "On the CD player, Ella Fitzgerald forgets the words to “Mac the Knife” one broiling night in Berlin over forty summers ago."
    - "She’s very watchable, like the motionless bass player in a hyperactive rock band."
    - "Finally a pair of jolly bear-sized Americans appear, thumping to earth with gusts of laughter and needing the ski-lift guy’s help."
    - "Holly talks about the band Talking Heads, like a Catholic discussing her favorite saints."
    - "Happiness did not enter feudal childhoods, and Klara’s was miserable even by the standards of the day."
