highlights:
- "Giovanni was far from me, drinking marc between an old man, who looked like a receptacle of all the worldâ€™s dirt and disease, and a young boy, a redhead, who would look like that man one day, if one could read, in the dullness of his eye, anything so real as a future."
- "It has been cold down here this winter, though the people of the region seem to take it as a mark of ill-breeding in a foreigner if he makes any reference to this fact."
- "I loved her as much as ever and I still did not know how much that was."
