highlights:
- "That’s the great value of art—making the ordinary extraordinary. We awaken ourselves to the life we are living."
- "We don’t need to now have our egos manipulate our words to sound better or the way we want to sound: perfect, happy, on top of everything."
- "Suddenly I didn’t know what the book was about; it didn’t have anything to do with my life. It wouldn’t find me a lover or brush my teeth in the morning."
- "When you know a place well, it’s a place. You might love it deeply, but it’s a place that has good and bad things. But having this place gives you a freedom to go anyplace and appreciate and love other places."
