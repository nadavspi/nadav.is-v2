highlights:
- "Your largesse is not of the ‘regal’ variety. The people of Sarkovy respect reckless liberality above all other virtues."
- "Sabra, on the shore of the north polar sea, was a drab haphazard city with a heterogeneous population whose main goal was to earn sufficient money to go elsewhere."
- "Her features were big and moist; her hair was short, mouse-brown, crimped and tied with string."
- "Like Earth, Navarth was old, irresponsible and melancholy, full of a dangerous mirth."
- "She was either extremely poised or vastly indifferent."
- "Navarth ordered dinner with enthusiasm and finesse; never had Gersen enjoyed a finer meal: one which made him regret the limits imposed by the capacity of his stomach."
