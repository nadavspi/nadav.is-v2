highlights:
- "It wasn’t that I was a child exactly, but I didn’t really have a history as anything else."
- "It turned out that Ralph had really specific and detailed thoughts about women’s clothes. “You could buy that and start carrying a straw bag,” he said of some kind of a tunic."
- "The whole week was depressing. I spent nine hours of it shivering, wrapped in the Gogolian coat, through a nine-hour documentary about the Holocaust. At some point I thought I had grown a lump in my thigh, but it turned out to be a tangerine—it had fallen through a hole in the pocket and ended up trapped in the lining."
- "A nurse said something that was almost definitely supposed to be my name."
- "In the cafeteria line I took a knife and fork. Ivan handed me another knife and another fork. I stared at the two knives and two forks. At the salad bar, Ivan put lettuce and tomatoes in a bowl and topped them with dressing. I also put some things in a bowl but at the end it wasn’t a salad, it was just a lot of random things in a bowl. At the soda fountain, Diet Coke seethed over my wrist."
- "At a table near the door, two students were slumped over their books, either asleep or murdered. In a corner, a girl was staring at a stack of flash cards with incredible ferocity, as if she were going to eat them."
- "Short aggressive men kept dancing up close to Lakshmi, who had found a way to incorporate rejection into her dancing, rolling her eyes and tossing her hair and angling her lovely shoulders away. Less frequently, one of the men would try to dance with me. I would nod in a businesslike manner and then turn away as if I had remembered something important I had to do. It went on and on, the dancing. I kept wondering why we had to do it, and for how much longer."
- "The jazz club was in a basement. The saxophonist was doubled over, face contorted, gasping between phrases. The sounds seemed to come from outside of life. You felt not just sorry, but also afraid."
- "“Are you sure you won’t be frightened when you wake up?” Margit asked. “Oh, no,” I said. I was frightened when I woke up."
- "Everything was covered in sour cream. “EAT,” Mrs. Nagy said, in both Hungarian and Russian, gazing into my eyes. “EAT.”"
- "The mall had a Japanese stationery store, where I bought a new spiral notebook. It had the most supple and creamy paper, and a pink cover decorated with a maroon anthropomorphic bean. The bean had one hand on its hip, and was waving with the other hand. It was a marvelous notebook."
