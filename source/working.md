# I build stuff on the web.

I lead the Front End team at [Something Digital](http://somethingdigital.com/), where I've worked on many projects using Magento, WordPress, React, and other platforms & frameworks. I write a lot of HTML, Sass, JavaScript, and some PHP and Ruby. I'm interested in process, accessibility, and the intersection of design and development.
