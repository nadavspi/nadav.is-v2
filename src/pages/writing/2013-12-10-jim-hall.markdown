Jim Hall died today at the age of 83. One of the true masters of the Jazz guitar, he had a fruitful career that began in the 1950s and continued into the 2010s. I love Jim Hall. 

I first heard him on *[Alone Together][3821-001]*, a live 1972 duo recording with [Ron Carter][3821-002] that I picked up early on because I recognized Ron's name. I love the intimacy and space that is possible in duo recordings and *Alone Together*—along with a few other live recordings of the two—is a fine example of this. 

Another great duo is the one with [Bill Evans][3821-003]. They released two albums together: *[Undercurrent][3821-004]* and *[Intermodulation][3821-005]*. I'm partial to *Undercurrent* because I got it first, but they're both great. 

Jim Hall sounds fantastic on Sonny Rollins' *[The Bridge][3821-006]*. This was Sonny Rollins' triumphant return from his first sabbatical—which lasted about three years—and marks the beginning of a more experimental period for the saxophonist. It's called *The Bridge* because, during his sabbatical, Sonny practiced on the [Williamsburg Bridge][3821-007].

One of my favorite records of all time is another Jim Hall duo: *[Jim Hall & Red Mitchell](http://www.discogs.com/Jim-Hall-Red-Mitchell-Jim-Hall-Red-Mitchell/release/2634844)*, recorded live at [Sweet Basil's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Basil_Jazz_Club) in 1978. When I was getting into [Red Mitchell](http://www.redmitchell.com/redm/biography), who deserves an article of his own, I found the LP in my university's music library, listened to it, and immediately ran home to get my laptop to rip it to MP3. I think it's out of print now, but some vinyl copies can still be found on the internet. The album is miraculously available on Grooveshark, so [go listen to it right now](http://grooveshark.com/#!/profile/Jim+Hall+and+Red+Mitchell/24285357)! 

As Red Mitchell says in the liner notes, "Jim Hall is a great little band."
